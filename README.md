### Introduction
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Java program which builds a graph, and detects if there exists an odd cycle.
A graph does not contain a cycle of odd length if and only if it is bipartite.
If a graph has an odd length cycle, then it cannot be bipartite. In bipartite graphs, there exist two sets of vertices, such that no vertex in a set is connected with any other vertex of the same set. In lehman's terms, this simply means that a graph with an odd number of edges, or children, is not bipartite, or cannot be traveresed, and therefore, has at least one odd cycle.

### Components
- **Driver.java** builds a graph of user choosing. Driver.java can be edited to build a custom graph, then detects if the graph has any odd cycles.
- **Node.java** consists of the class Node, which is what makes up each node of our graph. A node has its children (if any), its vertex, its childcount, and its State (see state.java). You can add a child, get a child, or get a vertex.
- **Graph.java** consists of the class graph. A graph has its vertex count, and its vertices. You can add a Node or get a Node.
- **State.java** is just an enum used by Node, BreadthFirst uses it to track which Nodes have been visited to detect for odd cycles. Each Node has its state, as a public global variable in the class.
- **BreadthFirst.java** is where we run our breadth first search (bfs). The bfs takes a parameter of type Node in its only function (bfs), and scans all child nodes. It is best to use the root node of the graph to find odd cycles, although, you could detect odd cycles within a subgraph of the graph, if you so desire. by that, I mean, one could easily use a non-root node. If the graph is cyclic, any Node will suffice.

### More on Node.java & Graph.java
- A Node is the smallest, indivisable unit of a graph.
- A node has its vertex (value) and its children, if any.
- So, say we have Node A, with two children, B and C. This constitutes graph W. Our graph X would look something like this: <br/>
>                         A 
>                        / \ 
>                       B   C
- Therefore, Node A, has two children, in my implemention of a Node, that would be represented as an array of Nodes: [B,C]. What if children of Node A looks like this: [B,C,D]? THis would constitute graph X </br>
>                       D 
>                        \ 
>                         A 
>                        / \ 
>                       B   C
- Now, let's say Node B also has two children [E,F], making graph Y. <br/>
>                       D 
>                        \ 
>                         A 
>                        / \ 
>                       B   C
>                      / \
>                     E   F
- Lastly, we can also establish that B also has a child in C. So, the children of B are [C,E,F], making graph Z: <br/>
>                       D 
>                        \ 
>                         A 
>                        / \ 
>                       B âˆ’ C
>                      / \
>                     E   F
- All of the above are represented as graphs. And much like the children, they can be represented as an array of Nodes, which is what I did in this implementation of a graph. The first dimension array represents the Node and the 2nd dimension array is each Nodes array of children. [A[B,C,D],B[C,E,F],C[],D[]]
- The final point to make here is, which graph has an odd cycle. Graph Z has an odd cycle because Node B has 3 cycles, and is therefore, not bipartite.




### Coming soon:
- Depth First Search to find odd cycles.
- Remove node from graph
- Remove children from Node (might get funky, probably best accomplished in graph class, or at least with help from graph class).
- Other operations on graphs, graphs are cool, at which point I will change the name of this repo to better align with that. "graphsAreFun" perhaps.
